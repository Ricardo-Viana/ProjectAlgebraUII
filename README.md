# ProjectAlgebraUII
<p>Program made for class Linear Algebra and Analytical Geometry.</p>
The program do a Scale Matrix and calculate her inverse by doing similar operations. 
<p>(Scale Matrix = variable "matriz" and Inverse = "matrizIdentidade")</p>
Most of the program are in Portuguese, because my class was in Portuguese.
